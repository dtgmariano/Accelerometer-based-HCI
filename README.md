Accelerometer-based-HCI
=======================

Development of an Human Computer Interface for controlling an Augmented and Alternative Communication System

Sensor Information:
The  device  consists  of  an  accelerometer  to  capture  voluntary
movements  performed  by  users  who  have  restricted  movement such as
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Firmware Information:
The microcontroller (MCU) receives the analog signal from the
accelerometer, process the data and sends through the usb communication
a message whenever the sensor is triggered. The trigger is activated
when a motion is applied to the sensor.

Software Information:
When a trigger message arrives by USB the application invokes a mouse
event (Click)

Abstract:
People with severe motor disabilities present reduction or absence of motor control. 
However, in different stages of these conditions, some people can perform voluntary movements of low amplitude. 
This paper presents the development of an Human Computer Interface - HCI - for controlling an augmented and 
alternative communication system. The device consists of an accelerometer to capture voluntary movements performed by 
users who have restricted movement such as patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
The sensitivity of the device is calibrated according to the amplitude of the dynamic action executed by the user, 
allowing the placement of the sensor in different body regions, for which the use has some level of motor control. 
The system was tested successfully in healthy subjects suggesting that the accelerometer can be used in patients with 
motor disabilities.
